This repository has my mods to Chillance's OpenSCAD version of the Cerberus Pup carriage:
http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:78967

The main mods are to narrow the body slightly so that the rollers grip, as well as add a few nut traps.  If you make this part, let me know, at brandon.heller@gmail.com.
